add sneakycorp.htb on ur /etc/hosts

talk to the interface by doing this:
```
nc 10.10.10.197 25
```
since we got to know port 25 is opened

No once in the netcat console very email using :

vrfy raj@mail.lab.ignite```

```

and then try https://tools.kali.org/information-gathering/smtp-user-enum to do an smtp enum.
offcourse it doesnt work so screw u,

make random shell scripts that also fail, now cry in the corner, play some games , ask your other two hacking buddies if u get something, and go back to square one.

Finally try sending random emails using the port enums seen here
