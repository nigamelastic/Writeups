My girlfriend, Eva has gone missing, I am so worried about her, I heard she wrote email to someone about where she was going, so I need to access her email but it's asking me some question to which I don't know answer of D:
I spoke to Mr. Underwood, her dad and he said she was asking some questions about her username somewhere on internet.
Can you help me find her ?

I need her cat's name
Where she lives (yes, we are in long distance)
